Passive sensor enabled RFID tags are gaining popularity day by day, not only among the research community but also among the industry and commercial world. WINDWare was developed with the intention to facilitate widespread adoption of these kinds of RFID tags, specifically the tags that embed sensor data within the tag ID (such as EPC) for data transmission.

WINDWare is developed at the [Adelaide AutoID Lab](http://autoidlab.cs.adelaide.edu.au). WINDWare is based on the [fosstrak](https://code.google.com/p/fosstrak/) an implementation of EPC global architecture.
